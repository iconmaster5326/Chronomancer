            <h3>v1.4.0</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Added mana cost and skill family to skill tooltips. Note that the current dataset does not yet contain cooldown or skill tag information; I hope to fix that soon.</li>
                <li>Added the concept of item and character level. Note that item level currently does not correctly affect the values of base enchantments (that is: health, mana, damage).</li>
                <li>Fixed issue where you could put multiple of the same enchant on an item.</li>
                <li>Fixed the favicon being the default angular.js one.</li>
                <li>Fixed issue with item enchant colors not rendering correctly after loading from a build.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>v1.3.0</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Added the ability to generate a link to the builds you make. They are not permalinks; they will not reflect changes you make after you get the link to the build!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>v1.2.0</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Added build importing and exporting. Right now it only imports and exports to a format local to Chronomancer; importing from Chronicon save files is a planned feature.</li>
                <li>The build you're currently working on will now be automatically saved and brought back up when reloaded.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>v1.1.0</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Added this changelog.</li>
                <li>Added a loading screen.</li>
                <li>Item sets now show up in tooltips.</li>
                <li>The item selection dialog is now more concise, and indicates when an item is part of a set.</li>
                <li>The Chronicon font should now render on any browser that doesn't install TTF fonts from Internet sources. (Which should be all of the browsers.)</li>
                <li>You can now ctrl-click as well as shift-click elements. Sorry, Firefox users, for making you unable to clear selected skills there.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>v1.0.1</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fixed rendering issues on Firefox.</li>
                <li>Fixed some broken skill tooltips.</li>
                <li>Items that have a base quality of Enchanted may now be generated at either Enchanted or Rare quality.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>v1.0.0</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Initial release.</li>
            </ul>
